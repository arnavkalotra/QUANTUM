Quantum Computing Internship (NAWCAD)

This repository contains work completed during my Quantum Computing internship at NAWCAD (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division). The focus of this project was updating and testing Qiskit quantum circuits to align with IBM’s latest framework and execution requirements.

Project Goals

Update older Qiskit circuits to use Qiskit’s new primitives (Sampler, Estimator).

Ensure circuits run successfully on both:

IBM Quantum Servers (hardware backends)

Qiskit AER Simulator (local simulation).

Modify tutorial-based circuits to meet current connectivity and job submission standards.

What’s Included

Updated Qiskit Circuits: Modified from Qiskit’s official documentation and tutorials.

Simulator Support: Verified compatibility with the AER simulator for faster local testing.

Quantum Server Execution: Circuits adapted to connect and run on IBM Quantum hardware.

In addition to this I was tasked with presenting an intro of quanutam computing to the air systems department, the slides are included as well.
